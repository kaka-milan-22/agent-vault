# agent-vault

Keep your secrets hidden from AI agents.

When AI agents help you set up services, secrets like API keys and tokens flow through LLM provider servers. **agent-vault** prevents this by acting as a secret-aware file I/O layer — agents see placeholders like `<agent-vault:api-key>`, never real values.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @botiverse/agent-vault
```

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Store a secret (interactive, masked input)
agent-vault set my-api-key

# 2. Write a config file using placeholders
agent-vault write config.yaml --content 'api_key: <agent-vault:my-api-key>
port: 8080'

# 3. Read it back — secrets are redacted
agent-vault read config.yaml
#      1  api_key: <agent-vault:my-api-key>
#      2  port: 8080

# 4. The actual file has real values
cat config.yaml
# api_key: sk-proj-abc123...
# port: 8080
```

## How it works

Secrets are stored in an encrypted local vault (`~/.agent-vault/`). When reading files, known secret values are replaced with `<agent-vault:key>` placeholders. When writing, placeholders are restored to real values. The agent never sees or transmits your secrets.

High-entropy strings not in the vault (like API keys added manually) are automatically detected and redacted as `<agent-vault:UNVAULTED:sha256:XXXXXXXXXXXX>` (12-char sha256 prefix).

## Command reference

### Safe commands

These commands never expose secret values. Both agents and humans can use them.

#### `agent-vault read <file>`

Read a file with all secrets replaced by `<agent-vault:key>` placeholders. Output format matches `cat -n` (line numbers, plain text).

```bash
agent-vault read .env
#      1  TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<agent-vault:telegram-bot-token>
#      2  OPENAI_API_KEY=<agent-vault:openai-key>
#      3  PORT=3000
```

#### `agent-vault write <file>`

Write a file, replacing `<agent-vault:key>` placeholders with real secret values.

```bash
# Via --content flag
agent-vault write config.yaml --content 'token: <agent-vault:my-token>
port: 3000'

# Via stdin / heredoc
agent-vault write config.yaml <<'EOF'
token: <agent-vault:my-token>
port: 3000
EOF
```

Fails with a clear error if any referenced key is missing:

```
✗ Error: Secret "my-token" not found in vault
  To add it, the user should run: agent-vault set my-token
```

#### `agent-vault has <key> [keys...]`

Check if one or more keys exist in the vault.

```bash
agent-vault has my-key           # prints true/false, exit code 0/1

agent-vault has a b c --json     # {"a": true, "b": false, "c": true}
```

#### `agent-vault list`

List all stored key names (never values).

```bash
agent-vault list                 # one key per line
agent-vault list --json          # {"keys": [{"key": "...", "desc": "..."}]}
```

### Sensitive commands

These commands involve secret values or destructive operations. They **require an interactive terminal (TTY)** and refuse to run without one. Agents should never execute these — they should tell the user to run them.

#### `agent-vault set <key>`

Store a secret value. Prompts for masked input. Warns before overwriting an existing key.

```bash
agent-vault set telegram-bot-token
# Enter value for "telegram-bot-token": ••••••••
# ✓ Saved "telegram-bot-token"

agent-vault set telegram-bot-token    # already exists
# ⚠ "telegram-bot-token" already exists (46 chars, set 2025-01-15T14:30:00.000Z)
# Overwrite? [y/N]

agent-vault set api-key --desc "OpenAI API key"

# Power-user variants — still require an interactive terminal (the TTY check
# is what blocks an agent from running this). --from-env reads stdin for the
# overwrite confirmation; --stdin needs --force to overwrite an existing key.
agent-vault set api-key --from-env OPENAI_API_KEY
echo "value" | agent-vault set api-key --stdin
echo "value" | agent-vault set api-key --stdin --force   # overwrite
```

#### `agent-vault get <key>`

View secret metadata, or the actual value with `--reveal`.

```bash
agent-vault get my-key
# Key:      my-key
# Desc:     My API key
# Set at:   2025-01-15T14:30:00.000Z
# Length:   46 chars

agent-vault get my-key --reveal
# sk-proj-abc123...
```

`--reveal` additionally checks that stdout is a TTY — you cannot pipe secret values.

#### `agent-vault set <key> --require-presence`

Gate this secret behind macOS Touch ID. Every subsequent decrypt (`write` substitution, `get --reveal`, `read` of a file mentioning it) blocks on a Secure Enclave biometric prompt — a LLM agent under prompt injection can call `agent-vault read` all it likes, but you have to physically touch the sensor for plaintext to flow.

```bash
agent-vault set wallet/mnemonic --require-presence \
    --reason "Sign Ethereum transaction"
```

Toggle on existing keys without re-entering the secret:

```bash
agent-vault require-presence wallet/mnemonic --on --reason "Sign Ethereum transaction"
agent-vault require-presence wallet/mnemonic --off
```

`agent-vault list` marks gated keys with `[presence]`. macOS only in v1 — see [`docs/PRESENCE.md`](docs/PRESENCE.md) for the full threat model, what's defended against, and what isn't.

#### `agent-vault rm <key>`

Remove a secret from the vault. Asks for confirmation.

```bash
agent-vault rm old-key
# Remove "old-key"? [y/N]
```

#### `agent-vault import <file>`

Bulk import secrets from a `.env` file. Shows a preview and asks for confirmation. Short/common values (like `localhost`, `3000`) are automatically skipped.

```bash
agent-vault import .env
# Found 5 entries:
#   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN → telegram-bot-token
#   OPENAI_API_KEY     → openai-key
#   PORT               → (skip: too short)
# Import 2 secrets? [Y/n]
```

#### `agent-vault init`

Initialize the vault at `~/.agent-vault/`. Automatically called on first `set` if no vault exists.

```bash
agent-vault init
```

#### `agent-vault scan <file>`

Audit a file for vaulted and potentially unvaulted secrets.

```bash
agent-vault scan config.yaml
# Vaulted (2):
#   line 1: matches "telegram-bot-token"
#   line 2: matches "openai-key"
# Unvaulted suspects (0):
#   (none)
```

## Agent integration

### Skill installation

```bash
npx skills add botiverse/agent-vault
```

The skill teaches agents:

- Use `agent-vault read` instead of the Read tool for secret-bearing files
- Use `agent-vault write` instead of the Write tool
- Never execute `set`, `get`, `rm`, `import` — tell the user to run them
- Use `<agent-vault:key-name>` placeholders in all config content

### How agents work with agent-vault

```
User:  "Help me set up a Telegram bot"

Agent: Let me check if you have the bot token stored.
       → executes: agent-vault has telegram-bot-token
       → false

Agent: I need your Telegram bot token. Please run this in your terminal:

           agent-vault set telegram-bot-token

       You can get the token from @BotFather on Telegram.

User:  (runs the command, enters token)
User:  "Done"

Agent: → executes: agent-vault write config.yaml --content '...<agent-vault:telegram-bot-token>...'
       → ✓ Written config.yaml (1 secret restored)

Agent: Config created. Your bot token is securely stored and I never saw it.
```

## Vault storage

All secrets are stored in a single global vault at `~/.agent-vault/`:

```
~/.agent-vault/
├── vault.json      # AES-256-GCM encrypted secrets (per-value encryption)
└── vault.key       # 256-bit master encryption key (0600 permissions)
```

Living in the home directory means secrets are shared across all projects and are never at risk of being committed to version control.

## Security

- **Secret values never appear in safe command output** — enforced by code, not convention
- **TTY requirement on sensitive commands** — prevents agents from calling `set` / `get --reveal` even through prompt injection
- **Optional Touch ID gate (`--require-presence`)** — for high-value secrets, every decrypt blocks on macOS Secure Enclave biometric verification. See [`docs/PRESENCE.md`](docs/PRESENCE.md).
- **High-entropy detection** — unvaulted secrets in files are automatically redacted on read
- **Vault outside project tree** — lives in `~/.agent-vault/`, never at risk of git commit
- **Encrypted at rest** — AES-256-GCM with per-value encryption
- **0600 permissions** — vault files are owner-readable only
